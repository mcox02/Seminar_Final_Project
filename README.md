# Seminar_Final_Project

Final Network data visualization for Grad School Seminar in Fall 2015

This viz takes data from all the papers assigned during the course of the class, then looks at the references that those authors use to create a network diagram showing who has the most influence among other authors within the field of architecture and urban design.
